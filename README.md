# Kaggle-Data-Science
**Flow of the project**

In this project we predicted the number of Rating and Views that a new dataset in the website Kaggle will get.
1. Crawling - in this file we crawl and scrape the data and saving it into a CSV file.
2. Data Cleaning - in this file we cleaned the data and fixing it.
3. Visualization - in this file we used visual plots that representing our out data and showing some intresting conclusions about the data.
4. Machine Learning - in this file we use regression models in order to find the best model that predict the best the rating and the views of new dataset.

**Final results:**
* With the Lasso model we achieve accuracy of 82.2% success about predicting the Rating of new dataset.
* With the Lasso model we achieve accuracy of 80.7% success about predicting the Views of new dataset.
